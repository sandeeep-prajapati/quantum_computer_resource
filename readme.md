## Introduction

This project is part of my effort to learn about quantum computing, focusing on both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation using Python and Qiskit. The topics covered range from understanding classical information theory to exploring quantum states and operations.

## Pre-course Survey

Before diving into the content, I completed a pre-course survey to assess my understanding and set learning goals for this quantum computing journey.

## Classical Information

### Classical States and Probability Vectors

Classical states represent information using definite values, such as 0 or 1. I learned how to describe these states probabilistically using probability vectors, which help model uncertain classical systems.

### Measuring Probabilistic States

In this section, I explored how to measure probabilistic states and interpret their outcomes, focusing on understanding how measurements affect the state of the system.

### Classical Operations

Classical operations are transformations applied to classical states. These include operations that manipulate data in a deterministic or probabilistic way.

## Quantum Information

### Quantum State Vectors

Quantum states, unlike classical ones, can exist in superpositions of states. I studied how to represent these states using vectors in a complex vector space, providing the foundation for understanding quantum computation.

### Measuring Quantum States

Measurement in quantum mechanics is more complex than in classical systems. I learned about the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements and how observing a quantum state affects it.

### Unitary Operations

Unitary operations are the basis of quantum computation, preserving the total probability (or norm) of quantum states. I explored how these operations can be used to manipulate quantum information.

## Qiskit Examples

To solidify my understanding, I worked with Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing software development framework. I implemented various quantum algorithms and examples to see how theoretical concepts translate into real quantum circuits.

## Vectors and Matrices in Python

Understanding vectors and matrices is crucial in quantum computing as they represent states and operations. I practiced using Python to manipulate vectors and matrices, laying a foundation for more complex quantum algorithms.

## States, Measurements, and Operations

This section consolidates knowledge about classical and quantum states, how they are measured, and how various operations affect them. It serves as a bridge between classical probability and quantum probability theories.

## Additional Topics

### Tensor Products

Tensor products are used to describe the combined state of multiple quantum systems. I explored how to construct and interpret tensor products to understand complex quantum systems.

### Partial Measurements

Partial measurements involve measuring only a part of a composite quantum system. I learned how this affects the overall system and how to use partial measurements to extract information without fully collapsing the system's state.
