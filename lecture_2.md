### **Introduction**
- **Classical Information:** Traditional representation of data using bits (0 or 1). It involves classical states, probabilistic states, measurements, and operations.
- **Quantum Information:** Uses qubits that can exist in a superposition of states. It involves quantum states, measurements, unitary operations, and tensor products for multi-qubit systems.

### **Classical Information**

#### **Classical States via the Cartesian Product**
- **Definition:** Classical states can be represented using the Cartesian product of basic states. For a system with two bits, the possible states are `{00, 01, 10, 11}`.
  
  **Example:**
  - For two classical bits, the state space is the set `{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}`. This is the Cartesian product of two sets `{0, 1}`.

#### **Probabilistic States**
- **Definition:** A probabilistic state is represented as a vector of probabilities. Each element in the vector corresponds to the probability of the system being in a specific state.
  
  **Example:**
  - A system with two states, `0` and `1`, could be represented by `[0.7, 0.3]`, indicating a 70% chance of being in state `0` and a 30% chance of being in state `1`.

#### **Measurements of Probabilistic States**
- **Definition:** The act of measuring a probabilistic state results in observing one of the states based on the associated probabilities.
  
  **Example:**
  - If a system has a state vector `[0.7, 0.3]`, measuring the system will return `0` with a 70% probability and `1` with a 30% probability.

#### **Operations on Probabilistic States**
- **Definition:** Operations on classical probabilistic states can change the probability distribution. These are typically represented by stochastic matrices.
  
  **Example:**
  - A transition matrix might be used to flip a state with certain probabilities:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.3, 0.7]])
    state_vector = np.array([0.7, 0.3])
    new_state_vector = np.dot(transition_matrix, state_vector)
    print(new_state_vector)  # Output: [0.65 0.35]
    ```

### **Quantum Information**

#### **Quantum States**
- **Definition:** Quantum states are represented by vectors in a complex vector space. A single qubit state is represented as `|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩` with `α` and `β` being complex numbers such that `|α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1`.
  
  **Example:**
  - A qubit in superposition can be represented as: `|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩`.

#### **Measurements of Quantum States**
- **Definition:** Measurement collapses a quantum state to one of the basis states, with the probability given by the square of the amplitude.
  
  **Example:**
  - For `|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩`, measuring it gives `0` with probability `0.5` and `1` with probability `0.5`.

#### **Unitary Operations**
- **Definition:** Operations in quantum computing are unitary, meaning they are reversible and maintain the total probability (norm) as 1. Common unitary operations include the Pauli gates (X, Y, Z) and the Hadamard gate (H).
  
  **Example:**
  - Applying the Hadamard gate (H) to `|0⟩` results in `1/√2(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`:
    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
    qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate
    qc.measure_all()
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
    print(result.get_counts(qc))  # Output: approximately {'0': 512, '1': 512}
    ```

---

### **Qiskit Examples**
- **Creating a Quantum Circuit with Qiskit:**
  ```python
  from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

  # Create a Quantum Circuit with 1 qubit
  qc = QuantumCircuit(1)

  # Apply Hadamard gate to put the qubit in superposition
  qc.h(0)

  # Measure the qubit
  qc.measure_all()

  # Execute the circuit on a qasm simulator
  simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
  result = execute(qc, simulator).result()

  # Print the results
  print(result.get_counts(qc))  # Output: {'0': ~500, '1': ~500}
  ```

---

### **Tensor Products**
- **Definition:** Tensor products are used to describe the state of multi-qubit systems. The state of two qubits is represented as the tensor product of individual qubit states.
  
  **Example:**
  - For two qubits both in state `|0⟩`, the combined state is `|00⟩ = |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩`.

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩
  zero = np.array([1, 0])
  one = np.array([0, 1])

  # Tensor product of |0⟩ and |1⟩
  combined_state = np.kron(zero, one)
  print(combined_state)  # Output: [0 1 0 0]
  ```

### **Partial Measurements**
- **Definition:** In multi-qubit systems, partial measurements allow you to measure a subset of the qubits while leaving the rest unmeasured. This can collapse the measured qubits' state while keeping the other qubits' state intact.
  
  **Example:**
  - In a system with two qubits `|ψ⟩ = |01⟩ + |10⟩`, measuring only the first qubit might result in it collapsing to `0`, leaving the second qubit's state undetermined.
